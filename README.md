# kid-knapping
Research compendium for 'What lithics can tell us about the evolution of learning and development' (Archaeometry).

## Getting Started
Please open the Rproj file instead of the Rcode directly to make sure relative paths work!

## File Structure
The repository is organised into four main directories: analysis, data, and figure.

### code
* `analysis.R` ... This is the R script generating the main results and figures of the experiment, especially the multi-level model of knapping performance.

### data
* `individual__data_by_participant.csv`... This csv file documents relevant attributes, particularly motor and psychometric test results, at the individual research participant level.
* `Table1.csv`... This csv file documents morphological and technological attributes of lithics at the core level.

### figure
* `Fig1.jpg` ... This is Fig.1 in the manuscript.
* `Fig2.png` ... This is Fig.2 in the manuscript.
* `Fig3.png` ... This is Fig.3 in the manuscript.
